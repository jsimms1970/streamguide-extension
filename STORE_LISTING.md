**Never wonder "where can I watch this?" again.**

StreamGuide automatically shows you where to stream any movie or TV show while you browse. A small widget appears when you visit movie pages, showing all your streaming options in one place.

**How It Works:**

1. Visit a movie or TV show page on IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, or Google
2. A widget appears in the corner showing where it's available to stream
3. See which services have it for subscription, rent, or purchase
4. Click to go directly to the watch page

**Features:**

• Automatic detection on supported sites - no clicking required
• Shows 50+ streaming services with direct links
• Displays subscription, rental, purchase, and free options
• Non-intrusive widget you can close anytime
• Remembers your preferences
• Fast and lightweight

**Privacy:**

We don't collect personal data. The extension only reads the movie title from the page to look up streaming availability. Your browsing history is never tracked or stored.

**Manual Search:**

Click the extension icon in your toolbar to search for any title manually, even on unsupported sites.
